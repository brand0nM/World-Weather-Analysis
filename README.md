# World-Weather-Analysis
## Project Overview
We've been tasked with creating a PlanMyTrip app; The user will input their desired temperature range and the app will filter those results, outputing a map of cities with hotels. 

### Purpose
Use python's random package to create a list of 2000 randomized GCS coordinates. Then retrieve the city name- if location is a city- and the local weather data from a rest API. Next ask the user to filter the results based on their ideal temperature range in degree's farenheight, and create a new dataframe with a close hotel in that city (using Google Map's api). Finally create a route for our vacation between the selected hotels, and list their info in markers on the map.
